    <th>Charles Babbage was born on Dec. 26, 1791 in England. He was one of four children born to Betsy Plumleigh Teape and Benjamin Babbage. His father was a banker.</th>

    <th>Charles moved around for his education as he was ill as a child due to fever. He would end up being sent to the countryside, and other schools along with having a private tutor at home. He eventually ended up at Holmwood academy in Enfield, Middlesex. This is where his love of mathematics started.</th>

    <th>1810 - 1814: He attended Trinity College in Cambridge and moved to Peterhouse College, Cambridge in 1812. He was the top mathematician. He graduated in 1814.</th>

    <th>1819 - 1822: Babbage built his first small model of the calculating engine (Difference Engine 0). Powered by cranking a handle, the machine calculated and printed mathematical tables. The machine was called a <q>difference engine</q> after the mathematical theory on which the machine's operation was based.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Difference Engine No.1 was designed to calculate and tabulate polynomial functions. Babbage was given Â£1,700 by the British Government to begin a full scale machine (Difference Engine No. 1). Over the years more than 10 times this amount of money was spent on the project. In 1832, a small working portion was built. In 1833, work on the full scale difference engine was stopped. <q>If the machine had been built it would have had over 25,000 working parts, weighted over 13 metric tons and have been over 8 feet (2.4m) tall.</q></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>In 1837, Babbage became interested in building a more ambitious analytical engine that would be more powerful than the original difference engine. This would be the first working computer for general-purpose computation. It would use punched cards for programming. A trial part was built but was never fully completed. He also designed a printer for his new engine.</th>

  <tr>
    <th>The government decided to stop funding the projects in 1842.</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>These machines were considered the <q>very first mechanical computers</q> to be invented. The fact that they were not actually built was due to a lack of funding and not due to any design flaw.

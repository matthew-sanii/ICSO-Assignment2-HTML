<h1>Charles Babbage</h1>
<h2>Inventor of the very first computer</h2>
<img src="./images/babbage.jpeg">
<p1 id="para"><br>He was born on December 26, 1791, in London, England, and died on October 18, 1871, in London<br></p1>
<p2 id="para">Has been called the <q>father of the computer</q><br></p2>
<p3 id="text"><q>A tool is usually more simple than a machine; it is generally used with the hand, whilst a machine is frequently moved by animal or steam power.</q></p3>
<p3 id="para">In 1812 Babbage helped found the Analytical Society, whose object was to introduce developments from the European continent into English mathematics.</p3>
<p4>In 1816 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.</p4>
<p5>He was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical (1820) and Statistical (1834) societies.</p5>
<p6>The idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables first came to Babbage in 1812 or 1813.</p6>
<p7>Later he made a small calculator that could perform certain mathematical computations to eight decimals.</p7>
<p8>Then in 1823 he obtained government support for the design of a projected machine, the Difference Engine, with a 20-decimal capacity. Its construction required the development of mechanical engineering techniques, to which Babbage of necessity devoted himself.</p8>
<p9>In the meantime (1828 - 39), he served as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.</p9>
